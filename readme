Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancerous death in women, accounting for more than a quarter of all cancers in women within the US. Survival rates increase as early detection increases, so there is an urge to develop improved methods for earlier detection \cite{FIGUEROA2021106585}. Of the many forms of breast cancer, the rate in which breast cancer cells grow is a strong indicator of a patientâ€™s prognosis. The most common technique for determining the proliferation speed is through mitotic count estimates, in which a pathologist counts the dividing cell nuclei in stained slide preparations to determine the number of mitotic bodies. Given this, the pathologist produces a proliferation score of either 1, 2, or 3, ranging from better to worse prognosis. Deep neural networks can provide a more reproducible and scalable method for mitotic count.
The present code is an attempt at counting mitosis in images from the MITOS & ATYPIA 2014 dataset.
